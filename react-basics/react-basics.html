               This is because react uses jsx, which means that you can write HTML inside javascript.
               The problem now is that the browser doesnt understand jsx, it only understands javascript alone.

               =>In order to use jsx, we need to translate it to javascript first.
               First, we load an external library called babel which translate the jsx into javascript
               Second, we have to give the script element an attribite; type="text/type";

               That attribute tells babel to translate the jsx into javascript.

         /*    ReactDom.createRoot() is used set up react inside any element that is going to be placed inside the paranthesis
               .render is used to display anything that is inside its parenthesis on the page.
               =>You cannot give .render multiple elements for it do display on the page
               =>You cannot assign multiple elements within the same variable.

               We can easily create the HTML elements we want and then giving it to react. This is way simpler than using the DOM feature in vanilla js
               If you want multipe elements to be displayed on the page, we can use do it this way:
